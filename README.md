### Zander Dumont-Strom

I'm a Computer Science BS Student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I have built all of my coding projects from the ground up, from planning and designing. The next step in my coding journey is to get an internship and apply my skills to the real world. I am excited to create code that solves real-world problems in the near future.
